# Design — Blog art + offer CTAs

**Date:** 2026-07-16
**Repo:** `lechner-studios` (the brand site)
**Status:** Design — awaiting owner review before implementation plan.
**Why:** The blog posts are text-only, and although every post closes with links to its pillar page and `/contact`, none of them ever points at a **productized offer**. The blog is the top-of-funnel surface; it currently hands readers to a generic contact form rather than to Website-Check (€290) or Direktbucher (from €3,900).

## Goal

Every blog post — the ten already published and every future auto-generated one — gets:

1. **Generated brand art**: a deterministic, on-brand hero band on the post and a small tile on the index.
2. **A matched offer CTA**: one card at the end of the post pointing at the offer that fits the topic.

Both must survive auto-generation. Retrofitting the ten existing posts by hand is a non-goal precisely because post #11 would silently lose the feature.

## Decisions (owner-approved)

- **Art = generated brand art**, not stock, not AI-per-post, not a curated library. Deterministic inline SVG derived from the slug, drawn in the Alpine palette. Zero licensing, zero per-post cost, no third-party fetch (so the DSGVO self-hosting rule is satisfied by construction), and it scales with auto-generation.
- **Placement = post hero + small index tile.** The index tile stays deliberately small — a **72px square** floated left of each row's text, inside the existing 40px-padded hairline row. `/blog` is an editorial hairline list, not a card grid, and it must still read as one. The hero is a **band at the full 880px column width, ~180px tall**, sitting between the H1 and the prose.
- **Offer mapping = per-topic `offer:` key in `topics.yaml`, defaulting to `website-check`.** Pillar-based mapping was rejected: `direct-booking-website-pension` — the one topic that most obviously wants Direktbucher — is filed under the `webdesign` pillar, so the pillar can't distinguish it.
- **Prices move to `src/lib/offers.ts`** as a single source of truth, shared by `HomeOffers.tsx` and the new CTA. This *shrinks* the Layer-0 exempted surface rather than growing it.

## Existing plumbing (reused as-is)

- Posts: `content/blog/<slug>.<locale>.md`, parsed by `src/lib/blog.ts` (gray-matter). `slug`/`locale` derive from the filename.
- `scripts/blog/`: `topics.mjs` (seed + pick) → `writer.mjs` (Claude) → `lint.mjs` (guardrails) → `emit.mjs` (write files), orchestrated by `generate.mjs`, which finishes with `npm run build`.
- Palette is CSS-variable driven: `--accent` `#254268` / `--accent-2` `#4A6A4E` (light), `#8FA8C5` / `#8FB89A` (dark).
- `.layer0-allow` exempts the files that intentionally carry public prices, keeping the pre-commit currency/PII scan active everywhere else.

## Two properties that keep this small

**`pickTopic` already spreads the topic entry.** `topics.mjs:55` returns `{ pillar, category, ...topic }`, so an `offer:` key added to a `topics.yaml` entry reaches `picked.offer` with **no change to `topics.mjs`**.

**The palette is variable-driven.** SVG drawn with `var(--accent)` adapts to dark mode with no second codepath and no theme prop.

## Architecture

```
topics.yaml (offer: optional, owner-steerable)
  └─ pickTopic → picked.offer ──────────────┐
                                            │  (never reaches the writer)
writer.mjs (Claude) → body + frontmatter    │
  └─ lint.mjs ── validates offer key ───────┤
      └─ emit.mjs ── offer → frontmatter ───┘
          └─ content/blog/<slug>.<locale>.md
              └─ blog.ts ── offer ?? "website-check" → BlogMeta
                  ├─ blog/page.tsx      → <PostArt> tile
                  └─ blog/[slug]/page.tsx → <PostArt> hero + <BlogOfferCta>
                                              └─ lib/offers.ts (price, href, title)
```

The writer is deliberately **not** told about offers. `offer` is owner data from `topics.yaml`, not model output — so `writer.mjs:18` ("NO prices, € amounts") stays true and `lint.mjs:9`'s € ban keeps protecting the post body. The price never enters the markdown; it is rendered by a component.

## Components

### `src/lib/offers.ts` (new)

Single source of truth for offer identity.

```ts
export type OfferKey = "website-check" | "direktbucher";
export type Offer = {
  key: OfferKey;
  href: string;                          // locale-less; callers prefix /${locale}
  title: string;                         // brand name, not translated
  price: { de: string; en: string };
};
export const OFFERS: Record<OfferKey, Offer>;
export const OFFER_ORDER: Offer[];       // check, then direkt — HomeOffers' existing order
export const DEFAULT_OFFER: OfferKey = "website-check";
export function isOfferKey(v: unknown): v is OfferKey;
```

`isOfferKey` is exported for the linter, so the validator and the renderer can never disagree about what keys exist.

### `src/components/HomeOffers.tsx` (modified — minimally)

Deletes its local `OFFERS` array, imports `OFFER_ORDER` instead. **Behaviour is unchanged**: it keeps mapping `dict.homeOffers.items[i]` to `OFFER_ORDER[i]` positionally, exactly as today.

That positional coupling is fragile (the file's own header comment at line 11 flags it: "Ordered to mirror dict.homeOffers.items"), but fixing it means restructuring `dict.homeOffers.items` into a keyed shape — out of scope here. Noted, not fixed.

Once the `€` literals leave this file, its `.layer0-allow` entry is removed and replaced by one for `src/lib/offers.ts`. Net: **the exempted surface shrinks from two files to one**, instead of growing to four.

### `src/components/PostArt.tsx` (new)

```ts
export default function PostArt({
  slug,
  category,
  variant,          // "hero" | "tile"
}: { slug: string; category: string; variant: "hero" | "tile" }): JSX.Element
```

- **Deterministic**: a small string hash of `slug` seeds the geometry. Same slug always renders identical output — no `Math.random()`, no `Date`. This is what makes it testable and what keeps SSG output stable across builds.
- **Family by category**: the category selects one of three geometry families, so all "Web & Design" posts look related while each post remains individual. A visual system, not ten unrelated pictures.
- **Themed by variables only**: fills reference `var(--accent)`, `var(--accent-2)`, `var(--border)`, `var(--bg-alt)`. No hardcoded hex, so dark mode is free.
- **Decorative**: `aria-hidden="true"` and `role="presentation"`. It carries no information the headline doesn't, so it takes no alt text — the right call for a screen reader, and consistent with the care already shown by the skip-link and `dict.a11y`.
- No files, no `/public` writes, no build step. Inline SVG in the server-rendered HTML.

### `src/components/BlogOfferCta.tsx` (new)

```ts
export default function BlogOfferCta({ offer }: { offer: OfferKey }): JSX.Element
```

Renders one card after the article body: mono overline, offer title, price, one-line description, arrow CTA. Visually a sibling of the `HomeOffers` card (same border/radius/hover language) so the site reads as one system.

Copy (label, description, CTA text) comes from a new `dict.blogOffer` block — **prices do not**, matching how `homeOffers` keeps amounts out of the shared dictionary to preserve the Layer-0 guard over all site copy.

### `src/lib/blog.ts` (modified)

- `BlogMeta` gains `offer: OfferKey`.
- **`offer: data.offer ?? DEFAULT_OFFER`** — the defaulting is what retrofits the ten existing posts with zero file edits. None of them is a pension topic, so `website-check` is correct for all ten.
- `readMetaForFile` and `getPost` currently build near-identical meta objects. Adding a field to both duplicates the drift risk, so extract a shared `toMeta(data, slug, locale)` and have both call it. Targeted cleanup, justified by this change.

### `scripts/blog/emit.mjs` (modified)

- `FIELD_ORDER` gains `"offer"` (last, so existing posts' field order is untouched).
- **Skip undefined keys.** The current loop assigns unconditionally:
  ```js
  for (const k of FIELD_ORDER) ordered[k] = frontmatter[k];
  ```
  With an absent `offer` this sets `ordered.offer = undefined`, which serializes badly. Guard it: only assign when the value is defined. Without this fix, every post lacking an explicit offer emits a malformed frontmatter key.

### `scripts/blog/lint.mjs` (modified)

One rule: `offer` may be absent, but if present it must satisfy `isOfferKey`. This catches a typo in `topics.yaml` (`offer: websitecheck`) at generation time rather than shipping a post whose CTA silently renders nothing.

### `scripts/blog/generate.mjs` (modified)

Passes `picked.offer` into both locales' frontmatter before linting. One line each for `en` and `de`.

### `content/blog/topics.yaml` (modified)

`offer:` documented in the header comment as optional, defaulting to `website-check`. Set `offer: direktbucher` on `direct-booking-website-pension` and any other pension/tourism topics.

## Data flow — the retrofit story

No existing `.md` file is edited. The ten published posts have no `offer` key, so `blog.ts` defaults them to `website-check` and `PostArt` derives their art from slugs that already exist. **The retrofit is a consequence of the defaults, not a migration step.**

## Testing

Matching the existing `*.test.mjs` pattern in `scripts/blog/`:

- `lint.test.mjs`: a valid offer key passes; an unknown key is rejected; an absent key is allowed.
- `emit.test.mjs`: `offer` is written when present; **no `offer` key is emitted when absent** (the undefined guard above); field order is stable.
- `offers.test.ts`: `isOfferKey` accepts exactly the keys in `OFFERS`; `OFFER_ORDER` matches `dict.homeOffers.items` length (guards the positional coupling that `HomeOffers` still relies on).
- `PostArt`: same slug renders byte-identical output twice; different slugs differ; output contains no hardcoded hex.

`generate.mjs` already ends with `npm run build`, which exercises `generateStaticParams` across every post in both locales — so a post that fails to render fails the generation run.

## Out of scope

- **`og:image`.** The art is inline SVG; social cards need a rasterized file at a URL. Different machinery, separate job. `generateMetadata`'s `openGraph` block is untouched.
- **Folding `WebsiteCheck.tsx` / `WebsiteCheckJsonLd.tsx` into `lib/offers.ts`.** They carry a price and schema.org `priceCurrency`; consolidating them is a larger refactor with its own JSON-LD risk.
- **Fixing the `HomeOffers` positional index coupling.** Needs a dictionary restructure.
- **Re-generating or hand-editing existing posts.** The defaults cover them.

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Generated art looks cheap and undercuts a deliberately editorial design | Three category families in the brand palette, small index tile, hero band constrained to the 880px column. Render and eyeball before merging — the design bar here is the existing index, which is genuinely good. |
| `.layer0-allow` edit is wrong → pre-commit blocks or the guard silently weakens | The allow entry moves `HomeOffers.tsx` → `lib/offers.ts` in the same commit. Verify by committing; the hook is the test. |
| `emit.mjs` undefined-key bug ships | Covered by an explicit `emit.test.mjs` case. |
| SVG bloats every post's HTML | Geometry is a handful of shapes, not a traced image. Keep it under ~2KB inline; it costs one fewer network round-trip than an `<img>` would. |
